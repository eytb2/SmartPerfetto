# Git and Submodule Rules

## Repository Remotes

Root repository:

- `origin`: `git@github.com:Gracker/SmartPerfetto.git`

Perfetto submodule:

- Path: `perfetto/`
- This is a fork of Google's official Perfetto repository.
- `origin` inside the submodule is upstream Google Perfetto.
- `fork` inside the submodule is Gracker's fork.

Never push SmartPerfetto submodule changes to upstream `origin`.

## Root Workflow

1. Inspect `git status --short --branch` before editing.
2. Preserve unrelated local changes; assume they belong to the user.
3. Run the verification tier that matches the change.
4. Stage only the files that belong to the requested change.
5. Commit with a descriptive message.
6. Push the active branch when the task asks for push/ship.

## Submodule Landing Order

When a task changes `perfetto/`:

1. Enter `perfetto/`.
2. Commit the submodule change.
3. Push that commit to the submodule `fork` remote.
4. Return to the root repository.
5. If the change affects the AI Assistant plugin UI or generated Perfetto UI
   output, run `./scripts/update-frontend.sh` and stage the resulting
   `frontend/` changes.
6. Stage the root gitlink (`perfetto`) plus required root artifacts.
7. Commit and push the root repository only after the submodule commit is
   reachable from `fork`.

Do not push a root commit that points to a local-only submodule commit. Docker
Hub and user installs consume the root `frontend/` prebuild and the root
gitlink; both must point to committed, pushed artifacts.

## Generated and Ignored Files

Expected ignored local state includes:

- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `.claude/worktrees/`
- `backend/logs/`
- `logs/`
- `backend/test-output/`
- `perfetto/out/`
- `node_modules/`

Do not add ignored runtime data unless the task explicitly changes ignore
policy.
